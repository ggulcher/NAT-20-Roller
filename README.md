# NAT-20-Roller
Version 2.0 of the original Dice Roller. Includes all the original functionality of selecting your chosen die to roll, the number of dice, as well as the result modifier. 2.0 now includes the addition of a Spellbook and Adventure Journal.

Your Spellbook allows you to:
- Organize your favorite abilities and rolls
- Record the current layout for your abilities
- Act as easy reference

The new Journal accomodates a playstyle that:
- Takes careful notes during sessions
- Prefers the roll of bard or storyteller
- Allows a small workspace for anyone crafting their words
